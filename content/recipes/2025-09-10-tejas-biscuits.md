**Ingredients**

* 100 grams of melted butter
* 100 grams of egg whites
* 40 grams of shredded coconut
* 70 grams of cornstarch
* 100 grams of powdered sugar
* a pinch of salt

**Method**

* We prepare this recipe ahead of time to let the dough rest. First, melt the butter and, while still warm, mix it with the egg whites.

* Add the shredded coconut, cornstarch, sugar, and a pinch of salt, and mix well. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for an hour.

* Preheat the oven to 170Â°C fan-assisted to warm it up. Line the baking sheet with baking paper.

* Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, using a spoon, place thin circles, leaving space between them. Make several baking sheets if necessary.

* Bake the tiles carefully because they bake very quickly, and each oven can vary the time. In mine, they're done in about eight minutes.

* When the edges of the cookies are golden brown and the centers are cooked, remove them and let them cool.  Then we put them on a rack so they stay crispy, although if you want to shape them into a tile, you'll have to place them on a rolling pin or a bottle while they're still hot.
