**Ingredients (15 empanadas)**

**Empanada dough**

 * 400 g flour
 * 50 g lard (or butter)
 * lukewarm water
 * 1 dessert spoon of fine salt
 * 1 egg yolk

**Filling for the empanadas:**

 * 2 onions, chopped
 * 500 g of minced veal meat
 * 1 teaspoon paprika
 * ½ teaspoon cumin
 * ¼ teaspoon white pepper
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 50 g seedless sultanas (currants optional)
 * 3 tablespoons stock
 * 2 boiled eggs
 * pitted green olives

**Method**

**To make the dough for the Argentinian empanadas:**

Put the flour in a bowl and in the centre add the melted butter, salt and egg yolk. Add the warm water little by little and mix until the dough can be picked up with your hands without sticking. Knead on the table until the dough is elastic and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Roll out to a thin thickness. Cut out discs about 12 cm in diameter.

**To make the filling for Argentinian empanadas:**

Sauté the onion in a little oil until soft. Add the meat and mix until it whitens. Season with the paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. Add the stock, mix again and remove.

Add the sultanas and olives and put in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. When preparing the empanadas, add a piece of boiled egg to each one.

**Assemble the Argentinian meat empanadas:**

Place a small amount of filling on a disc of dough. Moisten the edges of the dough with water and fold the dough over to join the edges. Fry until golden brown or bake them in the oven at 200°C, heat up and down, brushing them with beaten egg beforehand, until they are golden brown.
